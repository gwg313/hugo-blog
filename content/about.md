Hey there, tech pals! I'm Glen, and you've stumbled upon my little corner of the internet. Here's a glimpse into the tech and non-tech sides of yours truly.

## Tech Enthusiast

I'm dedicated to maximizing the utility and enjoyment of technology. Whether immersed in Linux, refining my Neovim setup, or exploring automation tools, with a passion for seamless and personalized tech experience. I'm also passionate about crafting keyboards, merging aesthetics with functionality.

## Fun with Keyboards
I enjoy building custom keyboards as a hobby and passion, using QMK and ZMK to enhance the typing experience. Explore my [keyboard configs on GitHub](https://github.com/gwg313/zmk-configs)

## Off-Tech Adventures

Life's more than just lines of code, isn't it? When I'm not immersed in tech, you'll catch me on a variety of off-tech adventures. Whether it's experimenting in the kitchen with a love for fiery flavors like Carolina Reapers, attempting to master my own culinary creations, you might find me on the tennis court, racket in hand, or simply grooving to some sweet tunes. It's all about embracing diverse and flavorful experiences beyond the digital realm.
